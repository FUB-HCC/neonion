## Our branch model

##### What is the "master" and "develop" branch for?

Currently, the "develop" branch has the most up-to-date features. We plan to merge the "develop" branch to the "master" branch.

In the future:

* The "master" branch will be the branch for use
* The "develop" branch will be the staging branch for new features

Note: the "docker" and "documentation" branch are working-in-progress branches for dockerizing the application and for documentation work.
